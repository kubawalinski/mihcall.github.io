<p><a href="https://twitter.com/matthewmccull">Matthew McCullough</a> took all of his courage and talked about art at tech conference - Øredev 2013 (<a href="http://blog.mihcall.com/2013/11/oredev-2013-inspirational-conference.html">amazing one by the way</a>). Matthew is a <a href="http://matthewjmccullough.com/">Github Trainer</a> and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022862.do">Git proponent</a>. His talk was one of the keynotes and I must say - he did really an amazing job in delivering his reasoning.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m convinced whether coding is an art or not even after Matthew&#39;s great attempt to convince us - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s a great, amazingly performed keynote that walks us through similarities of our profession to work of an artist. It has some good examples, accurate analogies, well thought confrontations. </p>

<p>I would highly recommend to watch Matthew&#39;s talk to look at what we do daily from another perspective. Can be really refreshing.</p>
