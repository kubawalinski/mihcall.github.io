          <h2>Message to next generations</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Feb 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Ever wondered how to leave a message to next generations? It&#39;s dead simple. You simply put a nice &quot;todo&quot; comment in the code. I can guarantee you&#39;ll never return to this place again. You&#39;ll never have to. It will be left to next generations. That&#39;s at least what&#39;s happening in the corpo world.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a short list of messages I found recently in code.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove this... later</li>
<li>To be removed when the causing xyz bug will be removed (no one really knows what this three-letter shorcut bug was... or is)</li>
<li>I&#39;m sorry - I was in hurry</li>
<li>Given enough time one should extract common logic to separate function, complex calculation logic makes it impossible to do it just hours before a release (originally a six-line comment)</li>
</ul>

<p>When I&#39;m reading these I feel like like a youngster finding a bottle with a message from the past. It&#39;s hard to tell what to do with the message but it feels like Something. You are amazed for a moment. Then the confusion comes, then you try to apply <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1235624&amp;seqNum=6">Boy Scout rule</a> and with a but of a luck - you simply remove the message together with some nasty production code attached. All the mystery passes away.</p>

<p>That would be mean to say - &quot;never do that to anyone, never put so useless comments creating more confusion than help&quot;. I can&#39;t really imagine a world without a hope that somewhere there&#39;s an undiscovered secret knowledge from the past. Maybe next found comment will reveal it...</p>

<p>Do you send similar messages to next generations? Did you receive any?</p>
