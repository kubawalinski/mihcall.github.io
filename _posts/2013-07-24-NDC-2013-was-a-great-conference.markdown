This was my first time at NDC this year but I can tell you - it's a great conference. 8 tracks, lot of brilliant speakers (just look at [agenda](http://ndc2013.oktaset.com/Agenda)), atmosphere was fantastic, organization was excellent (did you hear a term - Continuous Food?). Don't you believe? 

For all of you that couldn't attend - regret and... watch videos - they're available online now! Go and grab them on [vimeo](http://vimeo.com/ndcoslo).

Here's couple of my recommendations:

  * Want to see SignalR rewritten from scratch? Watch ["Under the covers with ASP.NET SignalR"](http://vimeo.com/68383353) by [David Fowler](https://twitter.com/davidfowl) and [Damian Edwards](https://twitter.com/DamianEdwards)
  * Watching closely battle between different js frameworks? See ["Cage Match - EmberJS vs. Angular"](http://vimeo.com/68215606) by [Rob Conery](https://twitter.com/robconery) and [Tom Dale](https://twitter.com/tomdale)
  * Want to github more effectively? Watch githubber in action: ["Effective GitHubbing: The GitHub Flow"](http://vimeo.com/68378254) by [Paul Betts](https://twitter.com/paulcbetts)
  * Don't be so antisocial you geek! ["Being an Anti-social Geek is harmful"](http://vimeo.com/68327405) by [Hadi Hariri](https://twitter.com/hhariri)

Let me know in comments which sessions were worth watching - I'll watch them and possibly add them to the list. I bet there is lot more to recommend than what I've seen so far!

Happy watching!
And remember - sharing (knowledge in this case) is caring :)
