For those of you scared or reluctant to present at meetups and conferences: Speak up! I'd like to listen to You.

Software developers are not eager to present for various reasons but there are at least few why they should start or present more often.

You do important and interesting things
--
I believe that every software developer encountered some interesting problem to solve during her/his career. There are so many stories to be told. I would like to listen to those stories, I would like to discuss with people in my industry more. Sharing an experience is the first step and probably the most important.

We work in an environment requiring constant learning, simply capturing this process can be beneficial to others. It can save time by avoiding future mistakes, it shows what is worth learning as well.

Speaking experts, speaking beginners 
--

Experts or creators may be not the best speakers. I have seen presentations delivered by software framework creators or subject matter experts that were simply boring. Additionally there were on the level *anybody* could present. Being an expert doesn't mean your presentation will be the most interesting and informational.

On the other hand, I have attended presentations given by people *only using* some technology (sometimes not even extensively) but who could present it in a way the first thing I wanted to do after leaving the room, was to open my notebook and start playing with it.

However if you want to be an expert, you don't have to be an expert on general *software development and life*, you can find yourself a tiny topic you'd be good at. You can be the expert on this tiny thing. Still I'd be interested in listenint to your story.

Being a beginner have the advantage of knowing *beginner problems* and most of your audience will be beginners, that's why they attend your presentation - they want to learn something they're not so familiar with. You can share "how it's like" to start working with particular technology, your personal gut feeling about it. Your honesty and genuineness will give your audience a confidence to ask questions, not always appearing while listening to an expert.

Lastly it is your opinion and perspective which makes a talk interesting. Even being less knowledgeable about the subject than your audience, you can present it in a way that will inspire people to look from a different angle at it.

So once again - you don't have to be an expert on the subject, you just have to be passionate about it. 

There's no them, there's only us
--

Looking at conferences lineups few years ago I was pretty sure there are only book writers, framework inventors and other famous people presenting. I realized in the meantime that they're full of people like me - doing their job, learning new things, getting excited by some, wanting to share this with others. I have attended more and more presentations done by people learning some technology just like me and it was really good to listen to their stories.

Conferences and meetups are places for everybody. Especially bigger conferences will have some really **big** names but also a lot of newcomers, lot of *ordinary* guys speaking about something interesting and/or interestingly.

Language
--

For some people, language is a barrier. We live in an English spoken culture and there's little we can do about it. Except for learning. And practicing. Even if you're at some reasonable level of your English language skills (you can understand people around you) speaking freely for an hour so that people want to listen to you requires a lot of practice. What would be the best way to practice English in a long, well-structured speech - a conference or a meetup talk, exactly. That's a great way to practice.

You learn a lot
--

If you want to present a subject, problem or a thought to a broader public, you'll find yourself looking at it from different perspective. You'll start preparing for questions you didn't think of, you'll try explore the subject as much as you can. You will learn a lot during this process.

You raise the bar, learning for yourself is one thing, learning so that other people can benefit changes the game a bit. Don't be afraid of this effect, no matter how much you learn - you won't learn **everything**. It's good to broaden your knowledge but the simple fact of thinking about your audience is enough most of the time.

Stimulating the community
--

Community is everywhere, I bet it is in your city as well, you don't have to be in ["Magic City of Tech Genius"](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6). Speaking at local meetup, local conference is one of the ways to stimulate this community. It gives it opportunity to discuss things, it makes it better.

I'm there trying to attend as much as I can, I'd love to listen to You!

Practice
--
You have to spend a lot of hours in preparation and practice. There's no other way but it pays off. There is a significant difference between speakers preparing for the talk and those who treat it a bit lightly. There are very few speakers with such an enormous talent they don't have to prepare. Most of the brilliant talks I've listened to were the result of practicing... a lot!

Remember that [Steve Jobs and Winston Churchill didn't start out as great speakers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/11/25/steve-jobs-and-winston-churchill-didnt-start-out-as-great-speakers/). Assume it will take time to learn it properly.

There are plenty of resources on how to be a better speaker. I would start with [Scott's video](http://speakinghacks.com/). There is also a great [website from Zach Holman](http://speaking.io/) on this subject as well.

After reading those and many other resources, it's all about practicing. Start early, start small, somewhere around you there is a group willing to listen to you, be it your team at work or a local meetup group. Maybe suggest you'll present at the next meeting?

It's time for You
--

I have a plan to submit to conferences I admire for years: [Øredev](http://oredev.org), [NDC Oslo](http://ndcoslo.com), [NDC London](http://ndc-london.com) and [BuildStuff](http://buildstuff.lt). I've already submitted two talks to NDC Oslo.

I would like to visit some User Groups in Poland as well. [Białystok .NET](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bstoknet/) is my favourite from 2014 because guys running it simply rock! I also started [dev@LDZ](http://www.meetup.com/dev-LDZ/) user group with [my team](http://blog.mihcall.com/2014/12/21/A-recipe-for-a-happy-software-development-team/) and at some point of time I will speak there as well.

Now it's time for you so **go ahead** and [submit your proposals](https://calltospeakers.com/)!

Hopefully see you there!
