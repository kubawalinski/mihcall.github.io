[Matthew McCullough](https://twitter.com/matthewmccull) took all of his courage and talked about art at tech conference - Øredev 2013 ([amazing one by the way](http://blog.mihcall.com/2013/11/oredev-2013-inspirational-conference.html)). Matthew is a [Github Trainer](http://matthewjmccullough.com/) and [Git proponent](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022862.do). His talk was one of the keynotes and I must say - he did really an amazing job in delivering his reasoning.

While I don't know if I'm convinced whether coding is an art or not even after Matthew's great attempt to convince us - it doesn't matter. It's a great, amazingly performed keynote that walks us through similarities of our profession to work of an artist. It has some good examples, accurate analogies, well thought confrontations. 

I would highly recommend to watch Matthew's talk to look at what we do daily from another perspective. Can be really refreshing.
