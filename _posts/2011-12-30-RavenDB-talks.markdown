I'd like to invite you to my RavenDB/NoSQL talks:

  * [5th of January at .NET User Group in Łódź](http://www.codeguru.pl/kalendarium/podglad-wydarzenia/raven-db---dokumentowe-bazy-danych,6004) (level 200)
  * 28th of January at SoftDevCon in Kraków (NO Power Point type of presentation)

Feel free to come, listen and discuss!

I hope I'll be speaking at some more events during this year. Now - let's go back digging inside some geeky, cool stuff.
