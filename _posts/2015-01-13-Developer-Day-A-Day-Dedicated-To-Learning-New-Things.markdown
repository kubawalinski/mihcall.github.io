We decided to dedicate one day a month to learn completely new technology, all members of [our team](/2014/12/21/A-recipe-for-a-happy-software-development-team/). We called it "developer day" - it's quite similar to [DevDay](http://devday.pl) in terms of that it's meant to be a fest for us. It's really **all about learning**.

Things we touched during this day are for example:

  * creating a [PR](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/10733) for AngularJS
  * understanding Ionic Framework better, using it to build an app using Ionic Creator
  * seeing how to create *iOS 8 CocoaTouch framework* (called also *iOS Universal Framework*)
  * playing with WebSharper to create [a web project](https://github.com/mihcall/confSpeakers)
  * Fullstack JS - playing with Yeogurt - React, Flux, Node, Backbone... lots of things...
  * understanding ReactJS more for [DevAgenda](https://github.com/scrcrw/DevAgenda) project
  * having *fun* with [FunScript](http://funscript.info/) - [Maciek](https://twitter.com/eldsharp)
  * NancyFx with F#
  * playing with [Freya](https://github.com/freya-fs/freya) framework


Some of them resulted in creating workable solutions, some of them were a pure learning excercises.

I managed to build very simple web app using F# and [WebSharper](http://websharper.com). I tried to write a summary during the day. [Here it is](https://github.com/mihcall/confSpeakers/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).

I have to say - for me this experiment worked extremely well. I got excited that I can do something totally unrelated to my day to day activities. I got interested in new technology and basically learned something.

I would encourage every team to do yourself a favor and **spend just one day to learn something new**. 

Tomorrow we'll have a session on what we learned and *of course* a round of feedback on how to make it better next time.

I'll update this post after I learn what other members of our team have achieved!
